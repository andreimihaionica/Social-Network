# Social-Network
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Network app created in Java using <b>JavaFX</b>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application allows you to create a new user by entering a username and password that will be stored encrypted in the database using the MD5 algorithm. Users can log in to the application and are greeted by a page with suggestions with other users who can be added as friends, but also have the option to search for a specific user. The logged-in user can also communicate with other users via email messages. It has the ability to view all friend requests, accept or reject them, and view all friends, which it can delete from the list. At the same time, the user can create events, the application notifying all users who subscribe to a certain event to remind them that the event takes place in a few days. Finally, the user can view statistics related to the number of new friends added and the number of messages received in a given time period, which can be saved in a PDF file. <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All data related to users, friends, messages, events and passwords are saved in a database to allow easy management, ensuring data persistence.
